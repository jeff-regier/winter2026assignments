Imagine repeating the learning procedure on multiple datasets. The lower the value for $k$, the higher the bias in the error estimates and the less variance **across datasets**. Conversely, when $k$ is set equal to the training+val sample size, the error estimate is then very low in bias but has the possibility of high variance **across datasets**."

The overlap is largest for leave-one-out cross-validation.
