    "\n",
    "**(a)** Name three variables **related to academics** that you could collect or measure about each student in this population. Of these three variables, one must be ordinal, one must be categorical, and one must be continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Suppose you have collected a dataset containing these variables for the population of students taking DATASCI 503 this semester. Now consider using this dataset to make inferences about a different population. Name another population about which we could plausibly make inferences. Name another population that would be more difficult to make inferences about."

    "\n",
    "**Answer 1a:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The three variables related to academics that we can collect/measure about each student in the DATASCI 503 population are as follows:\n",
    "1. Year (freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior) (ordinal)\n",
    "2. Major (data science, computer science, statistics, math, science etc) (categorical)\n",
    "3. GPA (contained in the range [0, 4]) (continuous)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 1b:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plausible Inference:**\n",
    "Using the data we gathered from the DATASCI 503 population we can make plausible inferences about the students taking another graduate level statistics course of a similar difficulty level. The reason for this is that variables like Year, Major and GPA are usually good indicators of the caliber and type of students taking a course. Under our assumption of the other population being with respect to a similarly difficult graduate level statistics course, we can expect the data to follow a similar distribution and pattern. This makes it possible to make valid and somewhat accurate inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not Plausible Inference:**\n",
    "Based on the above logic, it would not be plausible to make inferences about the students taking a completely different type of course in an unrelated field/domain (e.g., English 102). The reason for this is that the currently collected data will not have patterns present for the kind of students that are expected to take these new type of courses and therefore making any sort of inferences would be pointless and futile.\n",
