The reason for this is that variables like Year, Major and GPA are usually good indicators of the caliber and type of students taking a course. Under our assumption of the other population being with respect to a similarly difficult graduate level statistics course, we can expect the data to follow a similar distribution and pattern. This makes it possible to make valid and somewhat accurate inferences.\n",
