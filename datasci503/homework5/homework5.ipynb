    "Resampling methods are techniques that repeatedly draw samples from a training set and refit a model to each sample to obtain additional information about the fitted model. In this assignment, we explore two key resampling methods: **bootstrap** (for estimating the variability of an estimator) and **cross-validation** (for estimating test error and selecting models). These methods connect directly to the bias-variance tradeoff—cross-validation helps us choose models that balance underfitting and overfitting, while bootstrap helps us quantify uncertainty in our estimates."
